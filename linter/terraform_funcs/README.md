## Terraform Functions Package 

- The majority of the contents of this package have been directly lifted from the official
[Hashicorp Terraform GitHub repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform).
- Specifically, the contents of this package have come from the `terraform/lang/funcs` directory
located [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/master/lang/funcs).
- These functions were added to the Mphasis Stelligent Config-Lint tool repository to assist with 
parsing and resolving dynamic values from functions being called within Terraform config files.
